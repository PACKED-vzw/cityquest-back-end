# cityquest-mobile
 CityQuest allows cultural organisations to easily create a quest online, and publish it to a mobile app.   Send your visitors around the city to discover items from your collection and the locations they are connected to.   Based on hints and media you track down an item, scan the QR code on its location and learn the (hi)story behind it.
 
 This is the back-end application, responsible for creating and providing quests.

 Cityquest was created by [PACKED vzw](http://packed.be/) as part of the [AthenaPlus project](http://www.athenaplus.eu/) funded by the European Commission.
